HACKATHON 2:
DEVOPS:
 1. devops= development + operations
 2.developers(who write code)
 3. operations(who deploy/ manage systems)
 4.work together, instead of working of silos.
REAL TIME EXAMPLES:
 imagine you're building a mobile app like swiggy.
1.the developer writes code to add "Track my order" feature.
2.without devOps: Developer gives code to ops team they manually deploy,bugs happen,delays
3.with devops:code is automatically tested and deployed-------------- customers get updates faster and safety

devops helps you:
 1.release features faster(adding new payment methods in Zomato)
 2.fix bugs quickly(like fixing login issue in IRCTC)
 3.Automate repetitive  tasks(like serves restarts, database backups)

plan        define what to bulid     swiggy decides to add a 'dark mode"

develop     write the code           developers write java/kotlin code for ui

build       compile code into        android APK is buit automatically
            deployement format       

operate     keep app running, fix    monitor if app is crashing
            any issues

monitor     analyze performance and  firebase or new relic shows app metrics
            feedback                  


git: version control system
GitHub: online platform to store git projects
